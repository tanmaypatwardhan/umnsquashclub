        <p>Squash is racket sport typically played by two players on a 
        <br>
        four walled court with a rubber ball. Players take turns
        <br>
        hitting the ball on the front wall, and each player has 
        <br>
        to return the ball within two bounces. While the game's rules
        <br>
        are fairly simple, a standard rally has lot of strategy involved
        <br>
        that forces the player to think about factors like movement,
        <br>
        shot placement, and their opponents' weaknesses.
